# Mobile Challenges

There are a total of 4 Android based challenges that can be used to learn or practice your mobile pentesting skills. The challenges follow the **"Try Harder"** mantra, and can have multiple solutions depending on the skillset of an individual.

You can access the APK through one of the following two methods:
1. Clone the repository and import it in Android Studio and generate a build. (On how to do it, lot of articles available through Google)
2. A release APK is available for all challenges in the ***app/release/*** folder. (Directly download it and install on your device)

A brief walkthrough reference is also available for each challenge in challenge Readme.

My recommended approach to practice the challenges is to not read the source code or any walkthrough and to directly get your hands dirty by installing and opening the APK. That will allow you to start from Ground zero and build it up from there.
