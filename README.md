We use [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd/) as our platform to host our CTF.

All the challenges that require a network connection are running on top of Docker.

You can install docker on your system with a convenient script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh -

Add your user to docker group for convenient management

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
