Q: Dumbledore is the dean of this university. Try to find the user and root flag in his university.

To run this challenge on your host machine. Use the following command:

docker run --rm -itd -p 2002:22/tcp -p 8002:80/tcp faizal417/cg:ddworld

Note: This will expose the port 2002 and 8002 on your machine.
